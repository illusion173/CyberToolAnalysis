<h3 style="text-align: center;">Product Vision (Cyber Tool Assessment Project)</h3>
Our end product will be a public website that will enable users to filter through a variety of cybersecurity tools depending on the needs of the user (commercial, personal, etc.). All information regarding the tools and their attributes will be stored in a database. Recommendations will be generated from the database based on user preferences/requirements. Upon user request, a comparative report will be generated containing prospective tools and/or tools they already have.
